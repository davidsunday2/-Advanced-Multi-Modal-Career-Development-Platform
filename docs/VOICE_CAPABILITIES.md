    async def text_to_speech(text, voice, model, speed, session_id):
        """Convert text to speech using OpenAI TTS"""
        
    async def process_voice_message(audio_data, session_id, simulation_context):
        """Process voice message within simulation context"""
        
    async def generate_simulation_response(response_text, session_id, persona_config):
        """Generate AI voice response for simulation persona"""
```

#### API Endpoints (`app/api/routes/voice.py`)
